# WebBasedProjects
Some web based projects that I had up on my github.io site. They were removed to accomodate for a more professional resume page

# Running the files
The files are based on pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript so you can just inject them into a website or run them locally in your browser by downloading and running the html file.
