		<p>Welcome to my secure password generation website. It generates a secure (or at least secure enough) 12 character password. I know this isnt neccesary considering most sites 
			offer this when you sign up for their website,<br> and most people have a password manager that does this kind of thing for you anyway. But I thought it would be fun to make 
			and would be a good way to practice Javascript.
