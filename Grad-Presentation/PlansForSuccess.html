            <ul>
                <li>After High School I plan on going to Western Governors University and getting my bachelors in either computer science or software engineering.</li>
                <li>Once I get my bachelors, I plan to go to the Georgia Institute of Technology for my masters.</li>
                <li>I plan on finding and applying to internships and other opportunities.</li>
                <li>I will continue making projects and diversifying my portfolio.</li>
                <li>Ideally I will apply to do projects for other people so my name spreads as I try and find a good job in the tech field.</li>
                <li>You are never done learning and growing in the tech field. If you slow down or stop, the new advancements will leave you in the dust.</li>
