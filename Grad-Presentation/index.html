                <li>My name is Brodie Kirby and I am an IT Student. I am a computer nerd and I love anything to do with technology.</li>
                <li>I am a very empathetic and helpful person. I am always looking for oportuities to help others and am always there for those around me.</li>
                <li>I live in a family of 4 consisting of: My mom, My dad, and My brother Ben. I am the oldest of us two</li>
                <li>Others see me as a caring and smart individual, and tend to call me intellectual and hardworking. One of the downsides people see with me is im not very good at explaining things with just words, and tend to need visual examples.</li>
                <li>I am told by my teachers(or at least the ones who helped in my career) that I have great potential and am very advanced for someone my age.</li>
