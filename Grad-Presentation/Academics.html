            <h1>My Academic Career</h1>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <li>As a kid I was always very into technology, especially video games. Around 8th grade I started coding and trying to learn how to make stuff.</li>
                <li>My hobbies include playing video games, reading, coding, messing with programmable hardware(arduinos and raspberry pi), doing technical challenges, and other nerd stuff</li>
                <li>My acedemic focus at Western has been technology. Sadly there is never enough people that go into those classes, so it was rare I was able to study at Western. Luckly I went to the Career Center, who helped kickstart my career and everything that has brough me this far.</li>
                <li>Even with a lack of classes for me, I have managed to keep a decent GPA and make my way though it. I have taken a few AP classes here at Western, namely AP US History and AP Computer Science Principles.</li>
                <li>As a student I am usually very advanced and pass my classes with ease. The problems come when teachers lack the ability to help me for more than 30 seconds(this is not an insult to any teahcer, they just dont have the time and I understand) and when classes are inconsistantly hard. When a class flip flops with it difficulty I end up getting bored and it makes the harder parts feel harder.</li>
                <li>In the AP, PSAT, and SAT tests I do fairly well and do about the same in Math and in English. These test really didnt do much for me as they feel like they do little to help my future or any of the things I need. The one exeption is the Work Keys test which felt like a good assesment of work place skills</li>
                <li>On Xello, My evaluation recommended a mix of technology jobs and science. This isnt a bad evaluation, but some of the jobs they recommended included Biologist, Taxidermist, and Web Developer. Of these I am only interested in Web Development. Of course it recommended more tech jobs, but It took some scrolling</li>
