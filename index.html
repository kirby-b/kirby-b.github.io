            <p id="greeting">I am a highschool student who is studying computer programming. In my free time I like to play video games along with code and mess with various hardware(coding with Raspberri PIs, building computers, etc.).
            I have built multiple miniature programs since I started coding in 9th grade. Many of which may not be very "useful" due to them being terminal based games for the most part, but they are fun to play with and use.
            Along with being enrolled in high school I also attend the Bay Arenac ISD career Center. While there I have earned a student of the year award, completed a certifications from certiport, and furthered technical skills. 
            I have also competed in the Business Professionals of America Regionals, where I won 3rd in Java programming and 4th in Python programming.I also went to States, where I was a competitor. As a member of BPA I have also ran 
            for and won a position at our local chapter as an officer<br></p>
