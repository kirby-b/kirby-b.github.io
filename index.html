                            My name is Brodie Kirby, and I am a college student who is studying Computer Programming. In my free time I like to program and experiment with various other technology (Mini PCs, building computers, 
                            3d printing, etc.). I have experimented with many different branches of programming, and don't plan on stopping soon. As of right now I have the most experience with Game Development, Python Programming, and Web 
                            Development. All of my projects (for the most part) end up on github or some other code sharing platform, so if you are interested please check it out.
                            <br><br>
                            The biggest help on my path in the technology world has been the Bay Arenac ISD Career Center. While there I have earned a Student of the Year Award two years in a row, completed certifications 
                            from certiport, and furthered technical skills. The BAISD Career Center has also helped advance my skills by enrolling me as a member of The Business Professionals of America. As a member of BPA I ran for and won a position 
                            at our local chapter (Michigan Region 7) as an officer , competed on multiple levels of competition, acted as a voting delegate, and won many awards (see below).
                            <br><br>
                            I am currently working on learning as many branches of programming as possible and I have found a few I am actively pursuing. I have the most experience with Web Development, but my current dream 
                            job would be in Software Engineering or Data Analytics. I have found that not only am I good at doing tasks related to these subjects, but I actually have fun doing it.
